# GuessTheCharacter
Final Project from a java class I took last year

It uses a pretty simple UI made with Java. The game invloves guessing the name of some popular Mario characters. The top half of the screen will be blacked out, 
hiding the character at the start. The bottom half of the screen has a text field that you can enter you guesses into, and a text area that displays messages for
the user. If you enter an incorrect response, a "wrong answer" sound will play, and a corresponding message will appear in the text area. After enough wrong
guesses, the text area will display a hint for the player. When the player guesses the name of the character correctly, a "correct answer" sound will play, and 
the top half of the screen will display the image of the character that was previously hidden.

UPDATE: I added the game in .exe form, so now you can play it without compiling it yourself or having to use the command line!
